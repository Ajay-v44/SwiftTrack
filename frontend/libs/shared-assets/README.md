# Shared Assets

This library was intended to store static assets like images and fonts. 

However, for better performance and scalability, we are currently using **Programmatic Assets** (React Components and SVGs) located in `@swifttrack/shared-ui`.

## Available Assets

- **Logo**: `<Logo />` (Import from `@swifttrack/shared-ui`)
- **Hero Background**: `<HeroBackground />` (Import from `@swifttrack/shared-ui`)
